# A Simple Framework for Contrastive Dictionary Learning (SimCDL)

This paper introduces a Simple framework for Contrastive Dictionary Learning (SimCDL), which leverages contrastive self-supervised learning for dictionary initialization and sparse representation. Integrating the SimCDL framework improves dictionary learning, leading to more robust, diverse, and incoherent atoms. Our experiments, conducted on several popular datasets in computer vision and machine learning, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.
